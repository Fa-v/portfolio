# Portfolio

This the first project for Udacity's front-end development nanodegree.

This is my first app and I've learned about HTML, CSS and JavaScript foundations. The main goal is to make a portfolio where all our Udacity's projects will be displayed. Tachyons.io was a real inspiration to learn and use CSS in a responsible and hopefully beautiful way.
